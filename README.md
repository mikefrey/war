War
===

Computer simulation of the card game, War.

Why?
----

While on a train from Galway to Dublin, my wife and I decided to play a game of War. The game took nearly the entire 2.5 hour train ride to complete (I won!). And there were many changes in the balance of power, which is one of the great things about the game.

This got me thinking about how I wished I could have gotten some basic statistics about the game. For example,
 * How often is a given card is traded? Which are the most traded, which are the least traded.
 * How often does the power balance switch from one player to another?
 * What is the overall effiency of each card won? (Kv2 vs KvQ)

War is a game of pure chance. There is no way to apply skill or strategy to the game, making it easy to simulate.
